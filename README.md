# Introduction

This is a demonstration of the core concepts of OOP in C++. The classes `CargoShip` and `CruiseShip` are subclasses to the class `Ship`. My notes on things to remember are commented in the source code. The file `ShipTest` contains the main function and demonstrates by using an array of `Ship` pointers and manipulating the objects through their functions.

This demonstration covers inheritance, polymorphism, friend functions, operator overloading and dynamic memory.

## Usage

Upon running the test, information of the array will be printed and then a series of modifications will be done to the array with the aftermath printed after each modification. Then the user will be prompted to input information for a `CruiseShip` object, and the final status of the array will be printed.
